Parts List:

-Buttons: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07Q6C3NSN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
-Arduino Leonardo with headers
-LED mount: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00NWFHA12/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
-4xM3 25mm bolts,3xM3 nuts (one of the nuts won't fit due to the Arduino header)
-Female Header strip (I used one of these for ground with the pins soldered together, and simply taped it to the bottom/back of the pedal with electrical tape): https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B012C59FQA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1. There are better and simpler ways for a ground, but I decided to use this since it was onhand and wasn't useful for much else.
